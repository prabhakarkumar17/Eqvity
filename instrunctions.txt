Steps we have followed to connect backend with blockchain network then with smart contract by the help of web3.js library :-

1. Created node/npm based project - npm init

2. Created server.js file

3. Added packages - npm install express
		    npm install web3
		    npm install hardhat

4. Started server with the help of express framework - app.listen(8000)

5. Created hardhat project - Ethereum dev environment - npx hardhat init

6. Started our local blockchain - npx hardhat node

7. Collected smart contract's address, abi and provider URL

8. Created instance of web3 - 
		const { Web3 } = require('web3');
		const web3 = new Web3(providerURL);

9. Connected our server.js file to blockchain network - const web3 = new Web3(providerURL);

10. Connected our server.js file to smart contract - 
	const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress)

11. Called our smart contract's method
	contract.methods.getName().call()
	contract.methods.setName("Virat Kohli").send();
